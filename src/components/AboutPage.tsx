        We're Pollify &mdash; a social polling application that allows users to
        vote on a new poll every day. Each poll varies in topic, and provides an
        opportunity for users to communicate with the rest of the community. But
        Pollify isnâ€™t just about voting &mdash; we provide demographics to see
        how different people vote based on who they are. Pollify was built by
        five UCLA students who wanted to provide a fun and engaging platform for
        people from all walks of life to share their opinions.
